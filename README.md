## Database Schema

The system automatically creates the following database structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    event_date DATE NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    capacity INT NOT NULL,
    current_attendees INT DEFAULT 0,
    status ENUM('PLANNED', 'ONGOING', 'COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED') DEFAULT 'PLANNED',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
